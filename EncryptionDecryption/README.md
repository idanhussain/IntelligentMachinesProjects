# Dexter Password Encryptor
## Introduction
This code provides a simple implementation of RSA encryption and decryption in both JavaScript and Python. The JavaScript module encryptor.js allows you to encrypt strings using a public RSA key, while the Python decryptor.py allows you to decrypt the encrypted data using the corresponding private RSA key. This encryptor can be integrated into web applications to secure sensitive data transmission.

## Libraries
- [js-encrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsencrypt):
A JavaScript library for RSA encryption and decryption. It supports key generation, encryption, and decryption.

- [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/):
